Designed for quantum computing enthusiasts, it supports both standard and parameterized rotation
gates such as Hadamard (H), Pauli gates (X, Y, Z), Controlled-X (CX), and rotation gates (RX, RY,
RZ) using Python and the streamlit framework to create and analyze quantum states and quantum
circuits. And enabling the design of complex circuits.

Users can visualize quantum circuits by analyzing circuit depth efficiency and observing
probabilistic measurement outcomes through engaging bar charts.
